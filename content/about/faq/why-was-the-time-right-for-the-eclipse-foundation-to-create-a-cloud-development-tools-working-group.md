Cloud native applications are of critical importance for todayâ€™s enterprises. According to a recent Eclipse Foundation survey, more than 80 percent of the developers have plans to create cloud native applications within the next 12-18 months. It is this demand that drove the formation of the Eclipse Cloud Development Tools Working Group (ECD WG), a vendor-neutral open source collaboration that will focus on development tools for and in the cloud. The ECD WG fosters the evolution and broad adoption of emerging standards for cloud-based developer tools, including language support, extensions, marketplaces, and developer workspace definition.
