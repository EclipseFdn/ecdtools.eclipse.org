                    <p class="brand-primary">Why did the Eclipse Foundation create the Cloud DevTools Working Group?</p>
                    <p>Cloud native applications are of critical importance for todayâ€™s enterprises. According to a
                        recent Eclipse Foundation survey, more than 80% of developers have plans to create cloud native
                        applications within the next 12-18 months. It is this demand that drove the formation of the
                        Eclipse Cloud DevTools Working Group, a vendor-neutral open source collaboration that focuses on
                        development tools for and in the cloud. This working group fosters the evolution and broad
                        adoption of emerging standards for cloud-based developer tools, including language support,
                        extensions, marketplaces, and developer workspace definition.</p>
