Introduce Standard developer Workspace definition (like a recipe) that will be used by many IDE products, and will enable portability and sharing between the different products.  

Standard developer Workspace aims to support all developer tasks, such as: code, compile, build, test, debug, and deploy, from a single user virtual appliance. It may include: IDE, technology stacks, toolchains, security and connectivity instruments, developed source-code and apps (build artifacts) storage.  

Note: the focus (and reference implementation) is cloud and kubernetes
