                        <h3>Calls</h3>
                        <h4>Community Calls</h4>
                        <p>We hold a call for our community regularly.
                        The aim of this call is to discuss upcoming
                        events, ongoing initiatives and give projects
                        the opportunity to share updates with the
                        community.</p>
                        <p>We use a publicly available document to
                        manage the meeting’s agenda. You can add
                        items to it anytime, we just ask you leave
                        your name and a way to follow up about it
                        before the event.</p>
                        <h4>Project Calls</h4>
                        <p>Several ECD Tools projects hold calls to keep
                        in touch with their communities. Please
                        consider attending if you leverage one of the
                        projects below or are just curious about
                        them.</p>
                        <p><a href="https://github.com/eclipse/che/wiki/Che-Dev-Meetings">Eclipse Che:</a> These calls are meant for Che
                        adopters and contributors to chat about
                        some project development details (can be
                        planning, concerns, or more technical
                        details). The goal is to better synchronize and
                        organize efforts of the various contributors in
                        order to make Che better.</p>
