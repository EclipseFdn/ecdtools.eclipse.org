        <p>The Eclipse Cloud Development Working Group (ECD WG) is a vendor-neutral open source collaboration that focuses on defining, promoting and implementing tools for cloud-native development.</p>
        <p>The ECD WG is driving the evolution and broad adoption of emerging standards for cloud-based developer tools, including language support, extensions, marketplaces, and developer workspace definition. In addition, the group will explore the impacts and optimizations for running developer tools in a cloud environment, including scale out / scale-to-zero execution of compute-intensive tasks like CI and testing.</p>
