The ECD WG works to accelerate the adoption of Cloud Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and container-based workspace management through the adoption of standards, the engagement with third party developer tool providers, and through the promotion of Eclipse Foundation projects to cloud developers.  

The working group:  

- Engages with the Eclipse and broader developer community to ensure broad adoption of emerging standards for cloud-based developer tools
- Coordinates interoperability work on Language Server Protocol (LSP), Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP), and other developer tool protocols (workspace lifecycle management, source control, continuous integration infrastructure, user management, etc), and propose evolutions to these protocols for additional use-cases
- Defines requirements for running developer workspaces, including runtime environments and developer tools, in a Cloud Development Environment
- Promotes the adoption of developer tool plugins, and plugin marketplaces to Eclipse Cloud Developer projects
- Collaborates on the joint promotion of standards adoption among Eclipse Cloud Developer projects
