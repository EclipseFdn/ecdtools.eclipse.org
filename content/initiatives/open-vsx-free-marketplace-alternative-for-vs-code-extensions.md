Open VSX is a free vendor-neutral extension registry for VS Code extensions.  

#### Why do we want to do this?  

VS Code Extensions are currently only published in Microsoft’s Marketplace, which disallows usage from non-Visual Studio products. We want to establish an open alternative, so that VS Code extensions can be consumed by other products as well.

Microsoft’s marketplace is not available as a self-hosted version nor is open-source. We want to allow installations of extension registry within company networks and make that code available under the EPL2.
