[Eclipse Cloud Development Tools](https://ecdtools.eclipse.org) (ECD Tools) is a community of members, adopters, developers, and other contributors that collaborate to define, promote and implement Web and Cloud-based development tools and drive the evolution and broad adoption of these tools.

You will find below ways to get involved.

## Open Source and Open Collaboration

The ECD Tools working group is a vendor-neutral community made up of Eclipse Foundation members that wish to freely collaborate on new technology development in the Cloud Dev Tools space.

Membership in the working group brings many [benefits](https://www.eclipse.org/org/workinggroups/), including joint marketing initiatives and direct access to a community of skilled and dedicated open source developers.

## Communication Channels

### Mailing lists

We use mailing lists for all official communications. They are freely accessible but you need an Eclipse.org account to be able to subscribe to them.

Most ECD Tools projects also have their own mailing list. You will find them on [this page](https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/).

## Calls

### Community Calls

We hold a call for our community regularly. The aim of this call is to discuss upcoming events, ongoing initiatives and give projects the opportunity to share updates with the community.

We use a publicly available document to manage the meeting's [agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w9QSdgxqyI81CbN8Jnrsq_DgmOT6Lsy19bD6UUtmBR4/edit?usp=sharing). You can add items to it anytime, we just ask you leave your name and a way to follow up about it before the event.

### Project Calls

Several ECD Tools projects hold calls to keep in touch with their communities. Please consider attending if you leverage one of the projects below or are just curious about them.

* [Eclipse Che](https://github.com/eclipse/che/wiki/Che-Dev-Meetings): These calls are meant for Che adopters and contributors to chat about some project development details (can be planning, concerns, or more technical details). The goal is to better synchronize and organize efforts of the various contributors in order to make Che better.
* [Eclipse Theia Dev Meetings](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/wiki/Dev-Meetings): Developers and everyone interested meet to discuss anything related to the development of Theia.
